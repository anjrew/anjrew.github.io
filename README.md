**How to serve this project**

In brief run: ```npm serve```

A breakdown of what this command does is:

1. When the app is compiled it will be compiled to the file `bundle.js'
2. We run the command ```npm run serve``` ('node ./bundle-server.js"') to serve this file on port 8080
3. 'bundle.js' is loaded via the initial 'index.html' file.
4. we serve the index.html file by running ```npm start``` (node index.js)
